This is a project written in c++

this program asks the user for values of A , B and C , where A, Band C are values towards the quadratic equation
in the form : Ax^2 + Bx + C 

The Quadratic Formula is derived from the process of completing the square, and is formally stated as:

	For ax2 + bx + c = 0, the value of x is given by: x = [ -b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ] / 2a
